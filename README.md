CPP-Calc is a simple calculator made in C++. It can be used in other
applications by simply using the other code. Its purpose in those applications
could be to evaluate expressions programmatically. Currently, it uses doubles as
its major numeric datatype and so, its calculations are only accurate to a
certain degree. Im the person solely responsible for the creation and
development of this software, so I will work to fix that particular issue.
